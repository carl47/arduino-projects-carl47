This is a simple Ifrared Remote receiver for use where 
only the code sent is required.

It blocks until a The IR receives a command of any type.

If the command is valid. That is 32 bits or 4 hex digits
sent at 38 kHz it exits with the command value.

This is the NEC IR transmission protocol.

It works for most common remotes.
